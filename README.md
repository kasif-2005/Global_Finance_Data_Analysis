Global Finance Analysis Summary
1. Stock Market Performance

Highest Average Stock Index Growth
Countries with the strongest stock growth over time can be identified by average daily change %.
Key Insight: Some emerging markets occasionally outperform developed markets despite smaller economies.

Positive Stock Performance Despite Negative GDP
Certain countries show resilient stock markets even during negative GDP growth.
Key Insight: Investors may be betting on future recovery, or stock markets are decoupled from real economy in some nations.

Stock Index vs GDP Growth
Positive correlation exists in most countries, but outliers highlight markets moving independently from GDP trends.

2. Inflation & Interest Rates

Highest Inflation Rates
Some countries face double-digit inflation, often accompanied by high interest rates to combat it.

Interest Rate vs Inflation

Not all countries follow the textbook inverse relationship.

Low inflation despite low interest rates occurs in fiscally disciplined economies.

3. Currency & Trade

Best Performing Currencies (YTD)
Countries with currency appreciation often have strong fiscal management or trade surpluses.

Weakening Currencies with Growing Exports
Some export-heavy economies benefit from a weaker currency, making exports cheaper and boosting trade.

4. Market Capitalization & Exchange Rates

Average exchange rates and market caps vary widely by country.

High market cap countries often coincide with stable or appreciating currencies.

5. Commodity Impact

Oil Prices & Inflation: Correlation varies by country; oil-importing nations show stronger inflation sensitivity.

Gold & Stock Market Sensitivity: Some countriesâ€™ equities are highly correlated with gold, reflecting risk aversion or commodity-driven economies.

Oil & Stock Index Performance: Mixed correlation; energy exporters vs importers show opposite trends.

6. Real Estate Market

High Real Estate Growth: Countries with booming property markets may indicate speculative growth.

Interest Rates vs Real Estate: Negative correlation in many countries; higher rates slow down housing markets.

Real Estate vs GDP Growth: Rapid real estate growth outpacing GDP may indicate housing bubbles.

7. Employment & GDP

High GDP & Low Unemployment: Ideal economic scenario seen in top-performing countries.

Employment Efficiency: Measured as GDP growth per unit of unemployment, highlighting countries effectively leveraging labor.

Interest Rates vs Unemployment: Mixed correlations; higher interest rates can sometimes increase unemployment due to slower investment growth.

8. Key Correlations
Metric 1	Metric 2	Observed Pattern
Oil Price	Inflation	High correlation in oil-dependent economies
Gold Price	Stock Index	Markets sensitive to gold in commodity-driven economies
Interest Rate	Real Estate	Often negative correlation; higher rates slow property growth
Interest Rate	Unemployment	Mixed; context-specific
ðŸ’¡ Highlights & Takeaways

Stock markets are not always tied to GDP; some countries maintain growth even in economic downturns.

Interest rate management matters, but low rates donâ€™t guarantee high inflation, and high rates donâ€™t always curb it quickly.

Currency trends strongly influence trade and export competitiveness.

Commodities like oil and gold still play a central role in inflation and market dynamics.

Real estate bubbles can occur where property growth outpaces GDP.

Employment efficiency is a useful metric for sustainable economic growth evaluation.
